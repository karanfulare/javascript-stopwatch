# javascript-stopwatch
Here i have created a basic stopwatch using vanilla javascript , html and css .


The css and Html are very basic , I havent used bootstrap I made it raw to enhance my css skills .


In my javascript I have commented the code that will help any beginer to understand it very easily ,
I have made use of setinterval() function and conditional statement to make my thing work , 
also I have used clearinterval which function which terminates the setinterval function .
